				<h2>Training to become a developer</h2>
				<p>85% of tomorrow's professions do not yet exist. If you want to get involved in computer training, this is an aspect to consider from the beginning. Indeed, most of the knowledge acquired in a 3 or 5 year long training course will be obsolete before it can even be put into practice.<br />A new technology or new framework appears every 6 months on average. The Wild Code School has chosen the 5-month training period to synchronize with this pace of technological change. At the end of each session, our trainers review the programmes and update the training standards to ensure that they are always up to date with the requirements of the job market.<br />As a result, the Wild Code School offers you intensive training to become a developer. We have designed an extremely effective training program that allows you to acquire the maximum number of skills in the shortest possible time. We achieve this efficiency through the use of digital tools in learning, project-based pedagogy and personalised coaching by our trainers.<br />At the end of the training, you will be able to design and develop a web application, integrate agile project management methods, understand and formalize the needs of a client and give clear and constructive feedback. You will of course master HTML, CSS, and you will be specialized in a programming language and an application framework: PHP / Symfony, JavaScript / AngularJS / Vue js / React or Java / Android /J2EE, depending on our schools.<br />The Wild Code School is 100% professionalizing, so that you are directly operational after the training. And above all, we'll teach you how to learn. You will have the necessary agility to organize your watch, continue to train yourself, learn other technologies and new languages.</P>
